# Spoontacular
*fancier than the official*

## Project Purpose
 
 Capstone project for the Sping 2019 UC Berkeley Full Stack Bootcamp. Individual project integrating the Spoonacular API.
 
## The Problem
 
What's for dinner?!

## The Solution

Find your next recipe in a number of ways. 

1. Not sure what the name of that recipe was but remember it had lentils? There's a search box for that. 
2. Not sure how many calories are in the recipe you're thinking about for dinner? There's a search box for that. 
3. Not sure what to do with the ingredients in the kitchen? There's a search box for that.
